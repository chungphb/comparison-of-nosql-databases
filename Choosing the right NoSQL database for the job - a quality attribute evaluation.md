* Creates a survey of the literature on the evaluation of NoSQL databases from a historic perspective.
  
  * There are ***4 clearly distinct periods*** of the evolution of NoSQL research:
    * ***Database type characterization*** (where NoSQL was in its infancy and researcher tried to categorize databases into different groups).
    * ***Performance evaluations***, with the advent of YCSB and a surge in NoSQL popularity.
    * ***Real-world scenarios*** and criticism to some ***interpretations of the CAP theorem***.
    * An even bigger focus on ***applicability*** and a reinvigorated focus on ***the validation of benchmarking software***.
  * There is not enough information to verify how suited each NoSQL database is in a specific scenario or system.
  * Each working system differs from another and all the necessary functionality and mechanisms highly affect the database choice.
  
* Identifies several future research directions towards the full coverage of software quality attributes in the evaluation of NoSQL databases.
  * There is a current need for a broad study of quality attributes in order to better understand the NoSQL ecosystem.
  * Research is currently ***lacking in terms of Reliability, Robustness, Durability and Maintainability***, with most work in literature focusing on raw performance.
  * The development of a framework for assessing most of these quality attributes would be greatly beneficial.
